Multi-User project
==================

Multi-user management with focus on a project to which everybody has access via sudo.

**Features:**
- User creation
- Jailing using docker (runs a one-time docker container for a ssh session) (optional)
- Giving limited sudo access to one command for project management (optional)
- ZSH configuration with oh-my-zsh extensions (optional)
- Optional SSH configuration per user (eg. what is allowed, if user can forward ports, if can forward X11, etc.) (optional)

**Example case #1:**
- There are multiple organizations managing their pages
- We deploy a docker project that contains multiple websites
- Each user can manage the docker project via `sudo ./make.sh ... something ...` instead of having access to global sudo

```

Blocking access for the user account
------------------------------------

1. Edit users.accounts variable
2. For specified user account please set `disabled: yes` 
    - NOTICE: Deleting whole user section from file will not have an effect, as the deployment will ignore that user and will not change it
      so the user account deletion is not possible, only blocking is possible
3. Run deployment
